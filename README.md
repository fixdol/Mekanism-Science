Mekanism: Elements is a mod that adds many scientific elements to Mekanism

This mod cannot run without the Mekanism

Feature
1) Infinite Ores
2) Radiation Irradiator
3) Ammonia & Nitric Acid
4) Helium Coolant
5) Medicine & Iodine Tablet
6) High-Quality Concrete

1) Infinite Ores
　・Seaawater Pump can extract Seawater from the Water in the ocean biome.
　・High-Performance Adsorbents can be used to extract metals present in trace amounts in Seawater.

2) Radiation Irradiator
　・The use of Neutron Source Pellets allows for more efficient neutron reactions.
　・It can also safely produce a fission reaction.

3) Ammonia & Nitric Acid
　・Compressed Air can make by Air Compressor.
　・Nitrogen is obtained by separating it from Compressed Air using Adsorption Separator.
　・Ammonia is made from Nitrogen and Hydrogen.
　・Burning it provides greater energy than Ethylene.
　・Nitric Acid can be made from Ammonia, Oxigen, and Water Vapor.
　・It can render Spent Nuclear Waste harmless.
　・Ammonium Nitrate, a compound of Nitric Acid, can make TNT and Fireworks Rocket 8 times more 　　potent.

4) Helium Coolant

   

    ・Helium is a new coolant that can be made from Yttrium.
    ・This coolant has a coolant efficiency of 1.5 and can activate fission reactor with a burn rate 1920 mb/t.
    ・Yttrium can be made from Strontium. Calcium Oxide Dust can be made together.
    ・Strontium can be made from Uranium Hexafluoride.

5) Medicine & Iodine Tablet
　・Syringe is made by Glass and HDPE Sheet. It can store 5 doses of Medicine.
　・This can be used to extend the duration of each medicine shot.
　・Medicine include the following types
　　1) Fire Retardant(made from Bromine)
　　2) Anesthestic(made from Xenon)
　　3) Levitation(made from Helium)
　・Iodine Tablet is made from Potassium Iodide.
　・Eating it reduces the radiation received by the player.

6) High-Quality Concrete
    ・High-Quality Concrete Powder is made from Calcium oxide Dust, Sand and Lead Dust.
　・High-Quality Concrete Clump is made by mixing High-Quality Concrete Powder with Water Vapor.
　・High Quality Concrete can be made by crafting High Quality Concrete Clump.
　・There are two main differences between Concrete and High-Quality Concrete.
       1) High-Quality Concrete has better explosion resistance than Concrete.
       2) High-Quality Concrete can be processed into Stairs and Slab.
       (Also, High-Quality Concrete has a smooth surface.)
   ・By all means, use it in buildings.
